Session Description

Tired of begging IT for one more license key? Feeling ghosted by that "renewal reminder"? It's time to set yourself free and swipe right on QGIS, your open-source hero: no expiration dates, no strings attached! In this fun hands-on workshop, we'll explore QGIS, where geospatial analysis is free, collaborative, and surprisingly powerful. You'll learn how to import and analyze real-world data, build beautiful maps, and join a global community of mappers who believe that knowledge and software should be open to everyone. Come join us for a session full of geospatial magic, data empowerment, and just a touch of rebellion. Because maps should be open, just like your mind and your software.
